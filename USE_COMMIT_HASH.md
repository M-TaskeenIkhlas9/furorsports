Sometimes Vercel needs the exact commit hash instead of the branch name.

## ✅ Solution: Use Commit Hash

### **Step 1: Clear the Input**

1. **Click in the input field**
2. **Select all** (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
3. **Delete it**

### **Step 2: Enter Commit Hash**

1. **Type exactly:** `46b6832`
2. **This is the commit hash** for "Force rebuild: Ensure Google Search Console verification code is deployed"

### **Step 3: Deploy**

1. **Click "Create Deployment"**
2. **Should work now!**

## 🎯 Alternative: Redeploy Existing

If commit hash doesn't work, try redeploying an existing deployment:

1. **Click "Cancel"** to close the modal
2. **Find the top deployment** (the one marked "Current")
3. **Click the three dots (⋯)** on the right
4. **Click "Redeploy"**
5. **This will deploy the latest code automatically**

## 🚀 Try This Now:

**Option 1:** Type `46b6832` in the input field and click "Create Deployment"

**Option 2:** Cancel the modal, find the top deployment, click three dots, click "Redeploy"

**Let me know which one works!** 🎯
