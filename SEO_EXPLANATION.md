# 🔍 SEO Explanation - Why Your Website Doesn't Appear on Google

## ❓ Why Customers Can't Find You on Google

### The Problem:
When someone searches "furorsports" or "furor sport" on Google, your website doesn't appear in the search results.

### Why This Happens:

#### 1. **Google Doesn't Know Your Website Exists Yet**
- Your website is new (just deployed)
- Google hasn't discovered it yet
- Google needs to "crawl" (visit) your website first
- This can take **1-4 weeks** for new websites

#### 2. **Missing SEO Information**
Your website currently has:
- ✅ Basic title tag: "Furor Sport - Professional Sports Wear"
- ❌ No meta description (the text that appears under your link in Google)
- ❌ No keywords
- ❌ No structured data (helps Google understand your content)
- ❌ No sitemap (tells Google all your pages)
- ❌ No robots.txt (tells Google what to crawl)

#### 3. **No Backlinks**
- Google discovers websites through links from other sites
- If no one links to you, Google finds you slower
- Social media shares help (Instagram, WhatsApp)
