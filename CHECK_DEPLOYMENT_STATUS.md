# 🔍 Check Deployment Status

## ✅ Yes, I Pushed the Code!

The verification code was pushed to your GitHub repository. Vercel should automatically deploy it.

---

## 🔄 How Vercel Auto-Deployment Works:

1. ✅ **I pushed code to GitHub** → Done!
2. ⏳ **Vercel detects the push** → Should happen automatically
3. ⏳ **Vercel starts building** → Takes 2-3 minutes
4. ⏳ **Vercel deploys** → Your website updates

---

## 🔍 Check if Deployment Started:

### **In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your "furorsport" project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Look for a NEW deployment at the top with:
   - **Commit message:** "Add Google Search Console verification code"
   - **Status:** "Building" or "Ready"

### **If You Don't See It:**
- Vercel might be delayed (can take a few minutes)
- Check if Vercel is connected to your GitHub repo
- Sometimes you need to refresh the page

---

## ⏱️ What to Do:

1. **Refresh your Vercel dashboard** (press F5)
2. **Look for a new deployment** at the top
3. **Wait for it to show "Ready"** (green status)
4. **Then verify in Google Search Console**

## 🚀 Alternative: Trigger Manual Deployment

If Vercel didn't auto-deploy:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. Or go to Settings → Git → Redeploy

---

**Visit your website and check the source code:**
1. Go to: https://furorsport-lac-one-35.vercel.app
2. Right-click → "View Page Source"
3. Press Ctrl+F
4. Search for: `OrPw63kWur5kib_4NvIUv-Wi9H8N9QcZOITeo0lah8E`
5. If you find it, deployment is complete!
