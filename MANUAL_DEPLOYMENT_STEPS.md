# 🚀 Manual Deployment Steps - Vercel

## ⚠️ Vercel Didn't Auto-Deploy

Since Vercel hasn't auto-deployed the new changes, let's trigger it manually!

## 📋 Step-by-Step: Manual Deployment

### **Option 1: Redeploy Latest (Easiest)**

1. **In Vercel dashboard**, go to "Deployments" tab
2. **Find the top deployment** (the one marked "Production Current")
3. **Click the three dots (⋯)** on the right side of that deployment
4. **Click "Redeploy"**
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for it to finish
6. **Check status** - should show "Ready" (green)

### **Option 2: Deploy from GitHub (If Option 1 doesn't work)**

1. **In Vercel dashboard**, go to "Deployments" tab
2. **Click "Create Deployment"** button (top right)
3. **Select your GitHub repository:** `M-TaskeenIkhlas9/ecommerce`
4. **Select branch:** `main`
5. **Click "Deploy"**
6. **Wait 2-3 minutes**

### **Option 3: Check GitHub Connection**

If neither works, Vercel might not be connected to GitHub:

1. **Go to Vercel Settings**
2. **Click "Git"** in the left menu
3. **Check if GitHub is connected**
4. **If not connected, connect it**

## ✅ After Deployment

Once deployment shows "Ready":

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** (for changes to propagate)
2. **Check your website:**
   - Visit: https://furorsport-lac-one-35.vercel.app
   - Right-click → "View Page Source"
   - Search for: `OrPw63kWur5kib_4NvIUv-Wi9H8N9QcZOITeo0lah8E`
   - If found, code is live!
3. **Go to Google Search Console**
4. **Click "VERIFY"**

**Right now, try Option 1:**
1. Click the three dots (⋯) on the top deployment
2. Click "Redeploy"
3. Wait for it to finish
4. Then verify in Google Search Console
