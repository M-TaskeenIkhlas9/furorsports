# ⚠️ Verification Code Not Showing - Fix Applied

## 🔍 Problem:

The verification code is in your `index.html` file, but it's not appearing in the deployed website.

**This happens because:**
- Vercel might be using a cached build
- The build process might not be including all meta tags
- Need a fresh build

---

## ✅ Solution Applied:

I've pushed a new commit to trigger a fresh build. Now:

1. **Wait for Vercel to auto-deploy** (should happen in 1-2 minutes)
2. **OR manually redeploy again** after the new commit

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### **Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deploy**

1. **Check Vercel dashboard**
2. **Look for a new deployment** with commit: "Fix: Ensure Google Search Console verification code is included in build"
3. **Wait for "Ready" status**
4. **Check page source again**

### **Option 2: Redeploy Again**

1. **Go to Vercel → Deployments**
2. **Find the NEW deployment** (should be at the top)
3. **Click three dots (⋯)**
4. **Click "Redeploy"**
5. **Wait for "Ready"**

---

## 🔍 After Deployment:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** after "Ready" status
2. **Visit:** https://furorsport-lac-one-35.vercel.app
3. **View page source**
4. **Search for:** `OrPw63kWur5kib_4NvIUv-Wi9H8N9QcZOITeo0lah8E`
5. **Should find it now!**

---

## 🎯 Alternative: Use HTML File Method

If the meta tag still doesn't work, we can use the HTML file method instead:

1. **Go back to Google Search Console**
2. **Use "HTML file" method** (download the file)
3. **I'll add it to your website**
4. **Then verify**

**Let me know if you want to try the HTML file method, or wait for the new deployment!** 🚀
