# 🚀 Manual Deploy - Vercel is Connected!

## ✅ Good News: Vercel IS Connected!

I can see:
- ✅ Repository: `M-Taskeenikhlas9/ecommerce` 
- ✅ Connected 1 day ago
- ✅ Events enabled

**But auto-deploy isn't working, so let's deploy manually!**

---

## 🎯 Manual Deployment Steps:

### **Step 1: Go to Deployments**

1. **Click "Deployments"** in the top navigation (next to "Settings")
2. **You'll see the deployments list**

### **Step 2: Create New Deployment**

1. **Click "Create Deployment"** button (top right, blue button)
2. **A popup will appear**

### **Step 3: Select Repository & Branch**

1. **Repository:** Should show `M-Taskeenikhlas9/ecommerce` (already selected)
2. **Branch:** Select `main` from dropdown
3. **Click "Deploy"**

### **Step 4: Wait for Deployment**

1. **You'll see a new deployment appear**
2. **Status will show:** "Building..." → then "Ready" (green)
3. **Takes 2-3 minutes**

## ✅ After Deployment is Ready:

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** (for changes to propagate)
2. **Check your website:**
   - Visit: https://furorsport-lac-one-35.vercel.app
   - Right-click → "View Page Source"
   - Press Ctrl+F
   - Search for: `OrPw63kWur5kib_4NvIUv-Wi9H8N9QcZOITeo0lah8E`
   - **You should find it!**
3. **Go to Google Search Console**
4. **Click "VERIFY"**

## 🔍 Why Auto-Deploy Might Not Work:

Sometimes Vercel needs a manual trigger after connection. After this manual deploy, auto-deploy should work for future pushes.

## 🎯 Do This Now:

1. **Click "Deployments"** tab
2. **Click "Create Deployment"**
3. **Select branch: `main`**
4. **Click "Deploy"**
5. **Wait for "Ready" status**
6. **Then verify in Google Search Console!**

**Let me know when the deployment is ready!** 🚀
